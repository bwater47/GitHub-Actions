- An application that I created for testing components with JavaScript using the library React.

## Description

- <strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for building this application was to create a failed test on an element, and then have it pass.
- <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was built to demonstrate my skills with test driven development.
- <strong>Problem Solved:</strong> This solves the problem of not having code that is tested before deployment automatically.
- <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> In this project, I learned how to test and deploy a test driven application that uses GitHub Actions to perform tests automatically before deployment.
