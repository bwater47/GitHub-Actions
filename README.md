- An application that I created for testing components using Vitest, GitHub Actions, Git Hooks, and JavaScript alongside the library React.

## Description

- <strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for building this application was to create a tangible demonstration of test-driven development by building an application with an intentionally failing test case, which I subsequently corrected.
- <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was built to showcase the practicality of my proficiency in test-driven development principles and methodologies.
- <strong>Problem Solved:</strong> This solves the problem of ensuring code quality and reliability by implementing automated testing and deployment through GitHub Actions.
- <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> In this project, I gained practical experience in applying agile methodologies through test-driven development, GitHub Actions, and Git Hooks. By integrating automated testing into the deployment pipeline, I learned how to enhance code quality and reduce risks associated with unstructured commits. This project deepened my understanding of the importance of rigorous testing in maintaining software reliability.
